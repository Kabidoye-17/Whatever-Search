# Whatever Search
## What
This a small repo containing a google chrome extension that adds on a growing list of search filters. 
## The Original Why
In October of 2025, I was looking for a cool and unique Halloween costume but I kept having to tag on "for black women/girls". That's what you have to do when you are not the default. Because I cannot change societal bias, I will just work around it. So, I decided to create this extension so when I do need to search up hairstyles or makeup tutorials, I don't need to be reminded that I'm different.
## A New Reason Emerges
I don't like seeing the AI overview on google. It makes my brain lazy and discourages independent research and thought. So, I have now also added on the option of turning on the filter "&udm=14" to get rid of it. I will probably keep this on at all times.
