# What Inspired It
This is the source code of a google chrome extension that I built inspired by Mukwende M, Tamonv P and Turner M, the authors of the book *Mind the Gap*. They noticed that there was a steep lack of representation in medical literature for how certain conditions present on darker skin in comparison to lighter complexions. [Read Here](https://www.blackandbrownskin.co.uk/mindthegap) This led me to reflect on my own experiences of not feeling representing online and in the media. It becomes especially apparent when I search for typical girly things like makeup and hair tutorials and I have to consciously tack on the words "for black women". While it is only 3 words, it's a constant reminder that I'm not the default, that I am different. This extension doesn't aim to dismantle all of the societal bias out there. However, it does try to minimise how visible the effects are.
## What Can you do with it
On the theme of inclusivity, I didn't want to personalise to my experience alone. I want it it to be able to be used by everyone. So, you are able to create your own query and param filters and have a personalised library that you and shrink and grow. It's as simple as toggle a filter on or off. Especially handy when you are doing an hour long session trying to find the perfect halloween costume.
